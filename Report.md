🏷️ Project Title:
పల్లె మాటలు (Palle Maatalu) – A Telangana Proverbs & Idioms Archive

📌 Problem Statement:
Traditional Telugu proverbs and idioms, especially those from Telangana villages, are slowly vanishing. These sayings carry local wisdom, humor, and values passed down through generations — but are rarely documented. There's an urgent need to preserve them before they're lost forever.

🎯 Project Objective:
To build a digital archive of Telangana proverbs and idioms by collecting, preserving, and sharing them through an easy-to-use platform. This will help in educating younger generations and celebrating local language and culture.

🛠️ MVP Features:
Input form to submit a proverb (Telugu)

Add meaning (in Telugu or English)

Add example/contextual usage

Option to upload pronunciation audio

Display and browse all submitted proverbs

👥 Target Users:
Students and teachers of Telugu

Rural elders (as content contributors)

Language lovers and researchers

General public interested in Telangana culture

⚙️ Platform Details:
Frontend: Streamlit app

Backend: JSON file-based storage (MVP stage)

Audio Support: .mp3, .wav, or .m4a

Offline Compatible: Lightweight, low-bandwidth design

Deployment: Hosted via Streamlit Cloud or local network for offline areas

🔍 Methodology:
✅ 1. Platform Development
Create a Streamlit form to enter proverb, meaning, usage, and audio

Store all submissions in a JSON file or later in a database

Display submitted proverbs with search functionality

✅ 2. Data Collection Strategy (Not via social media)
